Currently just a playground to quickly test a few ideas regarding a potential parquet format for MS data.
test files are available at the release

1. long format is compressed a bit larger than the conpressed mzML. Random access/chrom. extraction performance is not great
2. todo: try one row per spectrum / with data array (e.g. m/z) in cell
